# Lecture Notes
This repository contains notes personally taken while studying for the Master's Degree in Automation Engineering at the University of Bologna during the academic years 2022/23 and 2023/24. 

## Remark on the notes
These notes are all taken in latex. You may simply download the PDFs or take a look at the source code if you so wish. In order to take the notes I use a setup mainly inspired by this guide:
